# Programming Fundamentals Scenarios 1 & 2

This repository showcases the implementation of basic algorithms following programming best practices.

## Scenario 1: EvenOddChecker

The `EvenOddChecker` class provides a method to determine if a number is even or odd.

### Explanation

The program reads an integer from standard input and prints "even" if the number is even, and "odd" if the number is odd. It uses bitwise AND operation to determine the parity of the number.

### Compilation and Execution

To compile and execute the `EvenOddChecker` program, use the following commands:

```sh
javac -d bin src/co/edu/poli/algorithm/scenario1/EvenOddChecker.java
```

```sh
java -cp bin co.edu.poli.algorithm.scenario1.EvenOddChecker
```

## Scenario 2: DigitCounter
The DigitCounter class provides a method to count the number of digits in a given number.


### Explanation
The program reads a long integer from standard input and prints the number of digits. It counts the digits by repeatedly dividing the number by 10.


### Compilation and Execution
To compile and execute the DigitCounter program, use the following commands:

```sh
javac -d bin src/co/edu/poli/algorithm/scenario2/DigitCounter.java
```

```sh
java -cp bin co.edu.poli.algorithm.scenario2.DigitCounter
```
